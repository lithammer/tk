//! Backend Adapter trait.
//!
//! Commands and the sync engine consume this trait so tests can substitute a
//! [`crate::remote::fake::FakeAdapter`] without spawning real backend CLIs.
//! The contract data types it exchanges — [`BackendItemSnapshot`],
//! [`MutationView`], [`ApplyOutcome`] — are pure domain data under
//! [`crate::domain`].
//!
//! The trait takes `&mut self` because the only stateful implementation today
//! is the test fake (a consumed script queue); real adapters reach the backend
//! through an injected [`crate::proc::ProcRunner`] and hold no per-call mutable
//! state, so `&mut self` costs them nothing.
